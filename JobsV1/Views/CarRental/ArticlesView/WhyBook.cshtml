                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <p>
                    Convenience comes with a cost. With car rental services, cost is equated against time, comfort and convenience.
                    It’s a personal assessment whether the amount of money is worth the value of service.
                    To understand it well, below is the benefits of the car rental services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time - you get to use your time very well. Full control of your time.
                    No waiting for taxi. No que during rush hours. You roam around to best possible routes.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Comfort - expected to be higher quality than of public vehicle. Clean and fresh and more relaxed travel.
