                <h2>More Freedom</h2>
                <p>
                    While visiting the city, the last thing you want to worry about is the cost of taxi
                    service, bus service schedules, or finding the location of bus stops. Your goal is
                    to tour the city and discover the hidden gems off the beaten path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specially during this time of pandemic, irregular bus schedules, limited public transport
                    and difficulty in finding taxis around the city will restrict your options roaming around
                    for business or personal needs. When you book with us, you can have an exclusive vehicle
                    and driver assigned to you throughout your rental period. You can have the freedom and time
                    to go wherever you want to go.
                </p>

                <h2>Save You Money on your Hotel Accommodation</h2>
                <p>
                    A car rental can help you save money on your hotel accommodation. With a car rental,
                    you can pick a hotel that is further from the city center. Such hotels will usually cost
                    less than the one close to the city center. The money you save can be used to pay for fun
                    activities during your visit to Davao City.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h2>More Comfort</h2>
                <p>
                    When visiting Davao City, there are various options for travel including taxi or bus
                    transportation. However, it can be a major hassle, especially if you are traveling with family.
                    You will have to keep moving your luggage in and out of the buses, which increases your
                    level of discomfort. Besides that, if you forget anything in the taxi or the bus, it can
                    be very difficult to trace it.
                </p>

                <h2>Explore More Places</h2>
                <p>
                    With a car rental, you can visit remote places off the main roads where buses may not be
                    willing to go. We also provide the best routes and solutions to save time and explore more
                    places while you are here in the city. It will ensure that you get the most out of your visit
                    to Davao City.
                </p>

                <h2>Safety Car In Rental</h2>
                <p>
                    When you book with us, you can enjoy an exclusive use of the vehicle with or without a driver.
                    You can avoid public transport and observe the proper social distancing and safety measures set
                    by our local government. Our vehicles are properly sanitized with disinfectants on every trip.
                    We regularly sanitize our vehicles after every use with misting solutions and disinfectant sprays.
                    With us, you can be assured that we will make sure you are safe and secure while you visit Davao City.
