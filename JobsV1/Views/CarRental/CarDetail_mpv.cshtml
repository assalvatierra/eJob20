                <h2>Toyota Innova</h2>

                <p>
                    The Toyota Innova is an MPV, a sub-category of the SUV, based on the IMV platform, shared with the Toyota
                    Fortuner and Toyota Hilux. Sporting 7 seats and a softer suspension than its IMV cousins, it has become
                    popular with families in Asia. It comes with either a turbo diesel inline four or a gasoline inline four
                    engine; 2.8L and 2.4L for the diesel variants, 2.0 ad 2.7 for the gasoline variants. Transmission may be
                    a 6-speed automatic, or a 5-speed manual transmission. Despite being based on the same platform as the
                    Fortuner and Hilux, it is not designed as an offroader; it doesn’t come with 4-wheel-drive or a limited
                    slip differential. It being designed by Toyota, the Innova is very reliable whether it is used as a family
                    mover, a daily commuter, even a rental or a cab.  It is definitely designed towards families and is the best
                    of its class here in the Philippines.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Innova is only a little bit smaller than the Toyota Fortuner, a mid-size SUV, thus there is plenty of space
                    for the occupants. The Innova is readily available in a lot car rental companies as it is a very popular vehicle.
                    There is plenty of leg room for the occupants of this vehicle. With the front seats on a reasonable position, the
                    second row has plenty of room, even more room than a lot of SUVs, even when the second rows seats are moved all
                    the way forward to give room to the 3rd row passengers. The third row is a little small for adults over 5ft, but
                    moving the 2nd row forward gives the 3rd a generous amount of leg room. Head room great for all 3 rows, and has
                    plenty in terms of width. The Innova is also comfortable. As stated before, it has a softer suspension than the
                    Fortuner and a lot of other SUVs. The newer models have double wishbone type suspension in front, allowing more
                    movement of the wheels, and less on the passengers. The Innova offers two vents for the second row and another
                    two vents for the third row, insuring that all the occupants are comfortable with the temperature.  Some models
                    come with captain seats, which remove a seat in exchange for a pair of more prestigious seats. The third row can
                    seat three people comfortably and leaves plenty of space for luggage. There is an option to fold the 3rd row making
                    it a 5-seater with a large cargo area, and folding the 2nd row makes way for even more cargo. Renting a car with a
                    driver would be a great way to enjoy the Innova.
                </p>
